       " 'selftext': \"By first glance on the post, you might get the wrong idea. The story is a little long, but I'll try to summarize. *I have a defective 3080*. I mean, when I say defective, I mean the performance is lower than it should be, it's around 3070/3070 ti levels of gaming. I do 4K gaming, VR, and some rendering, and the GPU that I have right now isn't really working for that. I mean, it's still a functioning card, so I don't want to complain, and it still serve's my needs, but I bought a 3080 for... 3080 performance. I got this card in January, and I thought the performance issue's I had before were normal, and I didn't really want to complain because I had a 3080, and I only recently tested it.\\n\\nWhy am I asking for a 3080 ti? The mining on the card seems to be untouched. There are also a few other benefits to having it. I bought this card open box from Micro Center, and my theory is that someone tried some unsafe core-overclocking, redeemed the COD code that comes with 3000 series cards, and returned it. The VRAM seems to be untouched, save for a few MH/s while mining, but still very much worth it. I do have an extended warranty (which I will work with you on getting transferred, idk how it really works, but I have the original packaging and can forward you the receipt if that's enough?), and when I messaged Micro Center about it they said they can replace the card, but it would be LHR. I figured that I could get a little more than that if I trade it with a miner, which I'd figure I'd do because for what my card is actually worth I can get a free upgrade.\\n\\nA few more things about it; I do mine with it in my off time, I kept the vram under 95 ° C as to not degrade them, because I thought I'd keep it for longer than I did. I replaced the thermal pads on the card (which I did ask Micro Center about it, they said it's still covered by the warranty if I didn't break it, which I didn't) because I thought that'd be the problem with the low performance, and it was not. I didn't do too much, but the card does run cooler now than before, and from what I've heard the ASUS TUF is the best-cooled aib card. Not much else to say, I already have an offer for it from someone else, but that's a *maybe*, and *if* they can get a 3080 ti FE from a BB drop, so I think it'd be nice if I had a backup plan or if someone had a better offer. Now here are some benchmarks:\\n\\n*images aren't allowed on this sub, just take my word for it lol*\\n\\nMining - \\\\~82 MH/s @ 98°C, I remember trying it earlier and got 89MH/s, but when I just tried it I couldn't get it that high. I'm not that experienced in mining, and I almost always kept it under 95 ° C anyway, so you can probably get it higher if you really wanted too. Based on other cards and what I could gather, this is similar to that barring a MH or two, but the card's VRAM does run a lot cooler than most.\\n\\nUserBenchmark - 179%, ik UserBenchmark isn't the best for benchmarking, but it's still *a* metric. Compared to other 3080's, this is below the 8th percentile, which means there's almost no others benchmarked that's under this.\\n\\nUnigine Heaven Benchmark 4.0 - 1473\\n\\nUNIGINE Supersition (4K optimized) - 13368, compared to the leaderboards, this is comparible to an overclocked 2080 ti.\\n\\nUNIGINE Supersition VR (Future) - 6828\\n\\nI would like a custom card, but I guess I can't be picky with a defective card lol. I'm good with an FE, I just don't want to get a bad card like ZOTAC. I would strongly prefer to do this locally, because safer, but I guess I can do something else.\",\n",
